# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A **deep research agent** — a thin, opinionated assembly layer over the
[`deepagents`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) library
(currently v0.6.x) on LangChain 1.0 + LangGraph. Two files carry the weight:
`agent.py` (~130 lines) — *how* `create_deep_agent()` is wired — and `cli.py`
(~320 lines, the largest module here) — the human-in-the-loop interrupt/resume
protocol that wiring implies. `config.py`, `tools.py`, and `subagents.py` are
genuinely small support modules.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                          # install deps + the project itself (editable) into ./.venv
uv run python -m deep_research   # run the interactive REPL (the only entry point)
uv run pytest                    # offline test suite (no keys/network needed)
uv run pytest -m live            # opt-in tests that hit real Anthropic/Tavily APIs
uv run ruff check                # lint  (add --fix to autofix)
uv run ruff format               # format
uv run ty check                  # type check (Astral's ty)
```

- **Use the Astral skills.** When working with Python here, invoke the relevant
  `/astral:<skill>` — `/astral:uv`, `/astral:ty`, `/astral:ruff` — so that
  dependency management, type checking, and lint/format follow current best
  practices rather than remembered defaults.
- **A PostToolUse hook already runs ruff and pytest for you.** `.claude/settings.json`
  wires `.claude/hooks/post-edit.sh` to every `Edit`/`Write` of a `.py` file — as
  `bash <path>`, deliberately, so a lost exec bit can't silently disable the gate;
  wire any new hook the same way. It formats and autofixes with ruff, reports
  whatever ruff *can't* autofix, and — for edits under `deep_research/` or `tests/` —
  runs the offline suite (~1s, no keys, no network). A non-zero exit blocks with the
  failure in stderr. Both steps live in one script, in that order, deliberately:
  `ruff check --fix` rewrites the file, so a pytest run racing it in a parallel hook
  could read a half-rewritten tree. The same settings file `deny`s reads *and* edits
  of `.env` and `.deep_research/**` (live agent state: checkpoints, memories,
  *pending approvals*) — both gitignored, so git cannot undo damage to them — and
  `deny`s *edits* of `uv.lock`, which **is** committed: regenerate it with `uv lock`,
  never hand-edit it.
- **Tests** live in `tests/` (pytest). The offline suite is deliberately narrow —
  it targets the branching logic in `cli.py` and the load-bearing wiring
  invariants (the `open_agent()` assembly smoke test, the `GATED_TOOLS` safety
  gate, the Opus 4.8 no-sampling invariant, the `/memories/` route and its store
  namespace, and deepagents 0.7.0 backend readiness), not the agent's LLM output. Tests
  use *real* langchain/langgraph types so fakes match runtime shapes. The `live`
  marker is registered and **deselected by default** (`addopts = -m 'not live'`);
  those need real keys. New behavior should come with a test in the matching
  file; verify a safety/invariant test actually bites by breaking the source and
  watching it go red.
- **The project is installable** (`[build-system]` = hatchling; the import package
  `deep_research` differs from the distribution name `deep-research-agent`, wired
  via `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]`). So `uv sync` installs it editable and
  `import deep_research` works without a `pythonpath` shim.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): a `lint` job (ruff + `ruff format --check` +
  ty) and a `test` matrix over Python 3.11–3.13, all via `uv`. The offline suite
  needs no secrets. Keep it green.
- **No console-script entry point** — the app is invoked only as a module
  (`python -m deep_research` → `__main__.py` → `cli.main`).
- **`ruff` selects more than the defaults** (`[tool.ruff.lint]` in `pyproject.toml`):
  `E,F,I,UP,B,SIM,RUF,BLE`, with `E501` ignored because the formatter owns line
  length. `BLE` is load-bearing — it is what makes the `# noqa: BLE001` on the
  broad `except` in `cli.py::main` an *enforced* suppression; under ruff's
  defaults that rule is off, so the directive would be dead (`RUF100` catches
  exactly this). `target-version` is inferred from `requires-python`, so the
  3.11 floor governs `UP` fixes without a separate setting.
- **`ty`** (Astral's type checker) is a pinned `dev` dependency; run it with
  `uv run ty check`. Some source files carry inline `# ty: ignore[...]` comments
  — see the deliberate false-positive suppression in `config.py::build_model`.
- Requires `.env` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` (copy from
  `.env.example`). `config.missing_keys()` hard-exits the CLI if either is unset.

## Architecture: the three things that span multiple files

Editing any one of these means understanding the others.

### 1. Two-layer persistence, both disk-backed (`agent.py` + `config.py`)

Deep Agents separates two kinds of state; this project gives each a *different*
sqlite file so everything survives a restart with no DB server:

- **Checkpointer** (`SqliteSaver` → `.deep_research/checkpoints.sqlite`) — per-`thread_id`
  conversation, todo list, and any *pending HITL interrupt*.
- **Store** (`SqliteStore` → `.deep_research/memories.sqlite`) — long-term memory
  shared across *all* threads.

The bridge between them is `build_backend()` in `agent.py`: a `CompositeBackend`
whose `default=StateBackend()` (ephemeral, per-thread, but checkpointed) and whose
`routes={"/memories/": StoreBackend(namespace=lambda _runtime: MEMORY_NAMESPACE)}`
sends only that path prefix to the durable Store. **Consequence:** a file the agent
writes to `/memories/foo.md` is readable in the next session; anything it writes
elsewhere (e.g. `/report.md`) lives only in that thread. The system prompt in
`agent.py` encodes this convention, so changing the route or the prompt must stay in
sync.

`MEMORY_NAMESPACE = ("filesystem",)` is the Store namespace those files are filed
under, and its **value must never change**. It is exactly what deepagents' legacy
auto-detection resolves to for this app (its `assistant_id` branch is a LangGraph
Platform concept a local CLI never sets), so it is the key every note already in
`memories.sqlite` lives under — change it and the user's durable memory is orphaned,
silently. Passing it *explicitly* is separately required: a `StoreBackend` with no
`namespace` is itself deprecated for removal in 0.7.0.

The backend is passed to `create_deep_agent()` as an **instance**
(`backend=build_backend()`). deepagents also accepts a
`Callable[[Runtime], BackendProtocol]` factory there, and this project used to — but
the factory form, along with `StateBackend(runtime)` / `StoreBackend(runtime)` and a
`StoreBackend` with no explicit `namespace`, is deprecated for **removal in
deepagents 0.7.0** (the backends resolve the runtime themselves now). Hence the
`deepagents>=0.6.12,<0.7` cap in `pyproject.toml`: it is capped at the *minor*
because deepagents is 0.x, so that is where it breaks.

**Three tests in `test_agent_wiring.py` keep this 0.7.0-ready**, because the
deprecations fire at *different times* and no single test sees them all:
`test_backend_construction_is_free_of_deprecation_warnings` (the `runtime` form —
warns at construction), `test_memory_namespace_is_explicit_and_unchanged` (the
missing-`namespace` form — warns only when a store op actually *resolves* the
namespace, so the construction test cannot see it), and
`test_open_agent_passes_a_backend_instance_not_a_factory` (the factory form — it
asserts on what `create_deep_agent()` actually receives). None of these is reachable
from the assembly smoke test: a backend is not exercised until the first filesystem
tool call at *invoke* time.

### 2. The `interrupt_on` ↔ `checkpointer` dependency (`agent.py`)

`GATED_TOOLS` (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `execute`) is passed as `interrupt_on`,
which pauses the graph for human approval. **This REQUIRES a checkpointer** — the
pending interrupt is persisted there. The two are wired together in the same
`create_deep_agent()` call; don't add interrupts without a checkpointer, and note
that gating a *new* tool is just adding its name to `GATED_TOOLS` (a `True` expands
to all four decisions — `approve`, `edit`, `reject`, `respond`; an
`InterruptOnConfig` narrows them).

### 3. The HITL resume loop is split across `agent.py` and `cli.py`

`agent.py` declares *which* tools interrupt. `cli.py` implements the protocol that
drives them:

- `agent.invoke(...)` returns a state containing `__interrupt__` when a gated tool
  is proposed.
- The middleware bundles all of *one agent's* pending tool calls into a single
  interrupt whose value carries **two parallel lists**: `action_requests` (what the
  agent wants to do — name/args/description, and *not* what may be decided about it)
  and `review_configs` (per-tool `allowed_decisions`, keyed by `action_name`).
  `_collect_decisions` returns `dict[interrupt_id, list[decision]]` — one decision
  per `action_request`, in order, *within each interrupt* — and looks the permitted
  decisions up **by name**, not by position.
- **A turn can hold more than one interrupt.** The orchestrator dispatches each
  `task` call as its own concurrent graph task, and every subagent inherits
  `interrupt_on` — so two `researcher`s fanned out in one turn (which `SYSTEM_PROMPT`
  explicitly encourages) each raise their own. Resume therefore takes a **mapping of
  interrupt id → that interrupt's resume value**:
  `Command(resume={interrupt_id: {"decisions": [...]}, ...})`. A flat
  `Command(resume={"decisions": [...]})` makes LangGraph raise `RuntimeError: When
  there are multiple pending interrupts, you must specify the interrupt id when
  resuming`. The mapping is also correct for the ordinary single-interrupt case, so
  there is one code path — keep it that way.
- Resuming can hit the *next* gated tool, so `cli.py` **loops**
  `while result.get("__interrupt__")` until the turn finishes.

**The menu is not hardcoded, and must not be.** The middleware raises `ValueError`
if a decision's type is outside that tool's `allowed_decisions`, and `main`'s broad
`except` would swallow it into a one-line `! error:` — losing the whole turn. So
`_prompt_decision` builds its options from the `ReviewConfig` it is handed. This is
invisible today only because every `GATED_TOOLS` value is `True` (all four
decisions); the moment one becomes an `InterruptOnConfig` that drops `edit`, a
hardcoded `[e]dit` option would break the turn.

If you change what's gated, or how decisions are shaped, both `_collect_decisions`
/ `_prompt_decision` in `cli.py` and `GATED_TOOLS` in `agent.py` are in scope.

### Lifecycle: `open_agent()` is a context manager for a reason

The compiled agent holds open sqlite connections (checkpointer + store), so it's
only valid inside the `with open_agent() as agent:` block. Run the entire session
inside it (as `cli.main` does); don't return the agent out of the block.

## Orchestrator ↔ subagent model

- The **orchestrator** (`agent.py`, `SYSTEM_PROMPT`) plans with the built-in
  `write_todos`, can call `tavily_search` directly for quick lookups, and delegates
  breadth to the `researcher` subagent via the built-in `task` tool.
- The **`researcher` subagent** (`subagents.py`) runs with **isolated context** —
  it can't see the main conversation and is **one-shot/stateless** per `task` call,
  so its prompt must be self-contained. It exists to keep the orchestrator's context
  lean by absorbing many searches and returning one cited summary.
- `write_todos` and `task` are **built into Deep Agents** — they're not defined in
  this repo. Only `tavily_search` (`tools.py`) is a custom tool here.

## Model constraint (real gotcha)

The default model is `claude-opus-4-8`, built in `config.py::build_model()` **with
no `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k`** — Opus 4.8 returns a 400 if any sampling param
is sent. `ChatAnthropic` omits unset params, so leave them unset. Override the
model via `DEEP_RESEARCH_MODEL`; only widen sampling params if the target model
accepts them. Subagents inherit this model — the `researcher` dict in `subagents.py`
has no `model` key — so the rule covers them too.

`max_tokens` defaults to **16000** (`DEEP_RESEARCH_MAX_TOKENS`), and that is not
arbitrary: the CLI calls `agent.invoke()` (non-streaming), and 16k keeps a response
comfortably under the Anthropic SDK's HTTP timeout while still leaving room for a
synthesized report. Raising it materially means switching to streaming.

## Prompt caching is already on — don't wire it again

`create_deep_agent()` appends an `AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware` itself, to the
orchestrator *and* to every subagent (`deepagents/graph.py`, `_append_prompt_caching_middleware`).
It sets three breakpoints — last system-prompt block, last tool definition (which
covers the whole contiguous tool set), and a top-level `cache_control` in
`model_settings` that auto-caches the growing message tail. So the system prompt,
the tool schemas, and the conversation history are all cached already. Adding
another caching middleware via `middleware=[...]` would give you *two* of them
fighting over the same breakpoints; don't.

**This is easy to get wrong, so check before you "fix" it.** Nothing in this repo
mentions caching, and the middleware hooks `wrap_model_call` — which is *not* a
graph node, so it never appears in `agent.nodes`. Reading `agent.py` and `config.py`
gives no hint it exists, and the natural (wrong) conclusion is that every call
re-sends the prefix at full price. It doesn't. More generally: `create_deep_agent()`
does substantially more than its arguments suggest, so "this repo doesn't configure
X" is not evidence that X is off — grep the installed package before acting.

The default TTL is **5m**. That covers a whole turn (its many model calls fire back
to back) but expires while a human reads a report or sits on an approval, so a slow
turn re-writes its prefix. Leave it: the 1h TTL doubles the write multiplier
(2x vs 1.25x) to buy back only the idle gap.

`test_live.py::test_prompt_caching_actually_serves_the_prefix_from_cache` asserts the
cache is genuinely *read* (`cache_read` > 0), not merely that the middleware is
present — a prefix under Anthropic's 4096-token minimum would honor `cache_control`
and still cache nothing. Measured, the system+tools prefix is **~11.9k tokens**, so
it clears that bar with room to spare. The cache is keyed on the **prefix, not the
thread**: a brand-new `thread_id` reads a prefix an earlier thread (or an earlier
*process*) warmed. That is why the test runs two one-turn threads rather than two
turns on one thread — an opening turn can't hit the sharp edge where invoking fresh
input on a thread with a *pending HITL interrupt* resumes the model node on a message
list ending in an assistant message, which Opus 4.8 rejects as prefill (400). `cli.py`
never trips this because it loops on `__interrupt__` and resumes with `Command(resume=...)`
instead of sending a new turn.

## Extending it (where things go)

- **New tool** → build in `tools.py`, then add to `tools=[...]` in `agent.py`
  (orchestrator) or a subagent's `tools` in `subagents.py`.
- **New subagent** → return another `SubAgent` dict from `subagents.py`, add to
  `subagents=[...]` in `agent.py`.
- **Gate a tool** → add its name to `GATED_TOOLS` in `agent.py`.
- **Production persistence** → swap `SqliteStore`/`SqliteSaver` for the Postgres
  equivalents in `open_agent()`; the `CompositeBackend` routing is unchanged.
- **Env overrides** (all read in `config.py`): `DEEP_RESEARCH_MODEL`,
  `DEEP_RESEARCH_MAX_TOKENS`, `DEEP_RESEARCH_STATE_DIR`. All three are resolved into
  module-level constants at *import* time, so they must be set before
  `deep_research.config` is first imported — a `monkeypatch.setenv` in a test body is
  too late, which is why `tests/conftest.py` sets them as top-level code.
